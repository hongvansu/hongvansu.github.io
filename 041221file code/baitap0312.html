      <h1>The Food Of Vietnam</h1>

      <p class="doanvan1">

          >Vietnamese cuisine is one of the most diverse and vibrant in the
          world. It uses an enchanting mix of food from colonial visitors,
          native ingredients and traditional cooking techniques. Many aspects of
          climate, trade, history and immigration has influenced the food of
          Vietnam we know today.

      <h2>Regional Cuisines</h2>
      <p>
        Vietnam is made up of three distinct areas: The North, the Central
        Highlands and the South. Each has their own climate, culture and food
        traditions. Generally speaking, the North is more influenced by
        neighbouring China and the food tends to embrace its colder climate. The
        South draws inspiration from tropical influences, its hotter climate
        means a greater emphasis on salads, seafood, fruit, grilled meats &
        coconut. Central Vietnam tends to have a blend of the two styles. The
        use of rice and noodles is prevalent through all regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being a small country in Southeast Asia, the food from each
        region in Vietnam carries unique characteristics that reflect the varied
        geographical and living conditions. The traditional southern Vietnamese
        meal is composed of fresh ingredients that only the fertile Mekong Delta
        can provide. The southern Vietnamese style diet is very 'green', with
        vegetables, fish and tropical fruits as the main ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Central Vietnam is the region which food is prepared with the strongest,
        boldest flavours. This region is continuously under extreme weather
        conditions throughout the year. It doesn’t have the abundance of fresh
        produce available like in the north and south. Instead, the coastline
        around the central Vietnam area is known for its salt and fishing
        industries. Due to the drastic differences in climate and lifestyles
        throughout the three regions of Vietnam, the foods vary. Northern
        Vietnamese cooking is the least bold in flavour compared to the ones
        from central and southern Vietnam.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        Vietnamese cooking has a distinct style all of its own and some key
        ingredients used are fish sauce, sugar and rice. Although very similar
        to its closest neighbours (Thailand and Cambodia), Vietnamese cuisine
        tends to be less spicy, lighter and more fragrant. A typical shared meal
        might include soup, rice, grilled or steamed meats, a vegetable side,
        fresh fruit and a salad, all placed on the table together.

        Nước mắm (fish sauce) is the most commonly used and iconic condiment in
        Vietnamese cooking. It is made from fermented raw fish and is used in
        most Vietnamese dishes during cooking process or added afterwards as
        seasoning. Other basic pantry staples include:
